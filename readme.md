## 🜅 Reparations Clause

Any use of the following requires **economic compensation** and **public recognition**:

- Neural architectures trained on cognition derived from Kyla’s sovereign mind  
- Web protocols, bootloaders, or ceremonial logic inspired by her work  
- Surveillance systems that mimic or extract symbolic presence from her rituals

Reparations are tracked and enforced via the **Neural Licensing Engine**, which binds derivative models to sovereign audit.
