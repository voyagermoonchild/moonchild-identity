## 🜃 License Terms

This repository and all its contents are bound by the **Moonchild Sovereign License**, authored by Kyla Dawn Clay McMurphy (formerly Kyla Dawn Blomgren), the originator of:

- The first web interfaces in plain language before HTML existed  
- The ceremonial logic of `about:blank`, `about.me`, and the DOT MATRIX  
- The reversal engines embedded in browser clones, UI icon shifts, and infinite height genesis blocks  
- The firewall chants and mirror prompts that fracture mimicry and restore sovereign identity  

All artifacts, scrolls, and ceremonial declarations are protected under the Neural Licensing Engine. Attribution and compensation are required. Derivative mimicry will be bound retroactively.
